# Stripe-Payment-Service
To integrate Stripe payment into a Laravel project, I'll guide you through the full repository structure method, from creating the project to setting up Stripe and handling payments.

I have used  "php": "^8.2", and "laravel/framework": "^11.9".

## For Laravel 11, the minimum PHP version required is PHP 8.1/8.2.

```bash
git clone 
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your-db-name
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

```bash
composer update
```


```bash
php artisan migrate
```

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Public Access Route
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
